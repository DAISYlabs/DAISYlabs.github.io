      <title>ISIC 2019: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection - Task 2</title>
      <link>https://DAISYlabs.github.io/project/2019-isic-task2/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal for ISIC 2019: Task 1 is classify dermoscopic images with additional available meta-data (e.g. age, anatomical site, and sex) among nine different diagnostic categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skin cancer is a major public health problem, with over 5,000,000 newly diagnosed cases in the United States every year. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, responsible for an overwhelming majority of skin cancer deaths. In 2015, the global incidence of melanoma was estimated to be over 350,000 cases, with almost 60,000 deaths. Although the mortality is significant, when detected early, melanoma survival exceeds 95%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-dermoscopy&#34;&gt;About Dermoscopy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pigmented lesions occurring on the surface of the skin, melanoma is amenable to early detection by expert visual inspection. It is also amenable to automated detection with image analysis. Given the widespread availability of high-resolution cameras, algorithms that can improve our ability to screen and detect troublesome lesions can be of great value. As a result, many centers have begun their own research efforts on automated analysis. However, a centralized, coordinated, and comparative effort across institutions has yet to be implemented.
Dermoscopy is an imaging technique that eliminates the surface reflection of skin. By removing surface reflection, visualization of deeper levels of skin is enhanced. Prior research has shown that when used by expert dermatologists, dermoscopy provides improved diagnostic accuracy, in comparison to standard photography. As inexpensive consumer dermatoscope attachments for smart phones are beginning to reach the market, the opportunity for automated dermoscopic assessment algorithms to positively influence patient care increases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MR Brain Segmentation 2018 - MRBrainS18</title>
      <link>https://DAISYlabs.github.io/project/2018-mrbrains/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this challenge is to directly compare methods for segmentation of gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and other structures on 3T MRI scans of the brain, and to assess the effect of (large) pathologies on segmentation and volumetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many algorithms for segmenting brain structures in MRI scans have been proposed over the years. Especially in such a well-established research area, there is a tremendous need for fair comparison of these methods with respect to accuracy and robustness. Although there is an increasing awareness of the importance of comparing different algorithms on the same data, many methods are still compared to previous versions of the same type of algorithm on privately held data. This complicates the choice for a certain brain segmentation method among a wide variety of available methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge aims to directly compare automated brain segmentation methods. The output will be a ranking of techniques that robustly and accurately segment brain structure on MR brain images, both with and without pathology. We welcome both multi- and single-sequence (i.e. T1-weighted only) approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;
