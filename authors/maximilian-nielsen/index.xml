      <title>ISIC 2019: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection - Task 2</title>
      <link>https://DAISYlabs.github.io/project/2019-isic-task2/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal for ISIC 2019: Task 1 is classify dermoscopic images with additional available meta-data (e.g. age, anatomical site, and sex) among nine different diagnostic categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skin cancer is a major public health problem, with over 5,000,000 newly diagnosed cases in the United States every year. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, responsible for an overwhelming majority of skin cancer deaths. In 2015, the global incidence of melanoma was estimated to be over 350,000 cases, with almost 60,000 deaths. Although the mortality is significant, when detected early, melanoma survival exceeds 95%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-dermoscopy&#34;&gt;About Dermoscopy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pigmented lesions occurring on the surface of the skin, melanoma is amenable to early detection by expert visual inspection. It is also amenable to automated detection with image analysis. Given the widespread availability of high-resolution cameras, algorithms that can improve our ability to screen and detect troublesome lesions can be of great value. As a result, many centers have begun their own research efforts on automated analysis. However, a centralized, coordinated, and comparative effort across institutions has yet to be implemented.
Dermoscopy is an imaging technique that eliminates the surface reflection of skin. By removing surface reflection, visualization of deeper levels of skin is enhanced. Prior research has shown that when used by expert dermatologists, dermoscopy provides improved diagnostic accuracy, in comparison to standard photography. As inexpensive consumer dermatoscope attachments for smart phones are beginning to reach the market, the opportunity for automated dermoscopic assessment algorithms to positively influence patient care increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

      <title>PAIP 2019 Challenge - Task 2</title>
      <link>https://DAISYlabs.github.io/project/2019-paip-task2/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the challenge is to evaluate new and existing algorithms for viable tumor burden estimation in whole-slide images (WSIs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liver is a visceral organ most often involved in the metastatic spread of cancer. For the best practice, early diagnosis of liver cancer is important but many people don&amp;rsquo;t even know that they have hepatitis. Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC) represents about 90% of primary liver cancers and constitutes a major global health problem. The incidence of HCC is increasing both in Korea and worldwide; it is amongst the leading causes of cancer mortality globally. Between 1990 and 2015 newly diagnosed HCC cases increased by 75%, mainly due to changing age structures and population growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tumor is composed of various cellular and stromal components, eg tumor cells, inflammatory cells, blood vessels, acellular matrix, tumor capsule, fluid, mucin, or necrosis. The viable tumor burden is defined as the ratio of viable tumor area to the whole area of the tumor. The need for evaluation of viable tumor burden is increasing, as an assessment of response rates for chemoradiotherapy or proportion of tumor cells in genetic testing using tissue samples. Traditional pathologists use a semiquantitative grading system for residual tumor burden or report portion of necrosis indirectly indicating viable tumor burden.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://DAISYlabs.github.io/project/2019-ssim-pneu/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Th goal of this competition is to develop a model to classify (and if present, segment) pneumothorax from a set of chest radiographic images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine suddenly gasping for air, helplessly breathless for no apparent reason. Could it be a collapsed lung? In the future, your entry in this competition could predict the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumothorax can be caused by a blunt chest injury, damage from underlying lung disease, or most horrifying—it may occur for no obvious reason at all. On some occasions, a collapsed lung can be a life-threatening event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pneumothorax is usually diagnosed by a radiologist on a chest x-ray, and can sometimes be very difficult to confirm. An accurate AI algorithm to detect pneumothorax would be useful in a lot of clinical scenarios. AI could be used to triage chest radiographs for priority interpretation, or to provide a more confident diagnosis for non-radiologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenge&#34;&gt;Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
