The first problem is the effective use of high-resolution images with pretrained standard architectures for image classification. The second problem is the high class imbalance encountered in real-world multi-class datasets. Methods: To use high-resolution images, we propose a novel patch-based attention architecture that provides global context between small, high-resolution patches. We modify three pretrained architectures and study the performance of patch-based attention. To counter class imbalance problems, we compare oversampling, balanced batch sampling, and class-specific loss weighting. Additionally, we propose a novel diagnosis-guided loss weighting method which takes the method used for ground-truth annotation into account. Results: Our patch-based attention mechanism outperforms previous methods and improves the mean sensitivity by 7%. Class balancing significantly improves the mean sensitivity and we show that our diagnosis-guided loss weighting method improves the mean sensitivity by 3% over normal loss balancing. Conclusion: The novel patch-based attention mechanism can be integrated into pretrained architectures and provides global context between local patches while outperforming other patch-based methods. Hence, pretrained architectures can be readily used with high-resolution images without downsampling. The new diagnosis-guided loss weighting method outperforms other methods and allows for effective training when facing class imbalance. Significance: The proposed methods improve automatic skin lesion classification. They can be extended to other clinical applications where high-resolution image data and class imbalance are relevant.","tags":null,"title":"Skin Lesion Classification Using CNNs with Patch-Based Attention and Diagnosis-Guided Loss Weighting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohsin Shaikh","Alexander Schlaefer","René Werner"],"categories":null,"content":"Aim The purpose of this challenge is to directly compare methods for segmentation of gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and other structures on 3T MRI scans of the brain, and to assess the effect of (large) pathologies on segmentation and volumetry.\nBackground Many algorithms for segmenting brain structures in MRI scans have been proposed over the years. Especially in such a well-established research area, there is a tremendous need for fair comparison of these methods with respect to accuracy and robustness. Although there is an increasing awareness of the importance of comparing different algorithms on the same data, many methods are still compared to previous versions of the same type of algorithm on privately held data. This complicates the choice for a certain brain segmentation method among a wide variety of available methods.\nThis challenge aims to directly compare automated brain segmentation methods. The output will be a ranking of techniques that robustly and accurately segment brain structure on MR brain images, both with and without pathology. We welcome both multi- and single-sequence (i.e. T1-weighted only) approaches.\nResults Challenge https://mrbrains18.isi.uu.nl\n","date":1537056000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537056000,"objectID":"58163c049b112fa9d482548c41ef84d3","permalink":"https://DAISYlabs.github.io/project/2018-mrbrains/","publishdate":"2018-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-mrbrains/","section":"project","summary":"**7th rank of 40** unique teams in Task 2: Three Label Segmentation","tags":null,"title":"MR Brain Segmentation 2018 - MRBrainS18","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ivo Matteo Baltruschat","Thilo Sentker","Frederic Madesta","Rüdiger Schmitz","Helge Kniep","Nils Gessert","René Werner","Tobias Knopp"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533427200,"objectID":"9a455fce49c97136755df5a35a0ed3f7","permalink":"https://DAISYlabs.github.io/publication/2018baltruschatisic/","publishdate":"2018-08-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018baltruschatisic/","section":"publication","summary":"This manuscript summarizes our method and validation re- sults for the ISIC Challenge 2018 􏰃 Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection 􏰃 Task 1: Lesion Boundary Segmentation.
