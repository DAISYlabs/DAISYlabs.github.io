Our convolutional neural network based approaches utilize pre-trained weights for the FCN, SegNet, and DeepLabv3+ (i.e. with the Xception network backbone) as initialization. After training our networks on 90% of all skin lesion images and building an ensemble out of four best performing models, our approach yields a mean thresholded jaccard-index of 76.0% for the ISIC task 1 validation dataset.

The dataset consists of 10000 images with seven image-level classes to be distinguished by an automated algorithm. We employ an ensemble of convolutional neural networks for this task. In particular, we fine-tune pretrained state-of-the-art deep learning models such as Densenet, SENet and ResNeXt. We identify heavy class imbalance as a key problem for this challenge and consider multiple balancing approaches such as loss weighting and balanced batch sampling. Another important feature of our pipeline is the use of a vast amount of unscaled crops for evaluation. Last, we consider meta learning approaches for the final predictions. Our team placed second at the challenge while being the best approach using only publicly available data.","tags":null,"title":"Skin Lesion Diagnosis using Ensembles, Unscaled Multi-Crop Evaluation and Loss Weighting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nils Gessert","Thilo Sentker","Frederic Madesta","Rüdiger Schmitz","helge-kniep","Ivo Matteo Baltruschat","René Werner"],"categories":null,"content":"Write project text here\n","date":1524787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524787200,"objectID":"c87eded95a8c001b1811d17aa716a5cd","permalink":"https://DAISYlabs.github.io/project/2018-isic-task3/","publishdate":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-isic-task3/","section":"project","summary":"**2nd rank of 77** unique teams in Task 3: Lesion Diagnosis","tags":null,"title":"ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection - Task 3","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ivo Matteo Baltruschat","Thilo Sentker","Frederic Madesta","Rüdiger Schmitz","helge-kniep","Nils Gessert","René Werner"],"categories":null,"content":"Write project text here\n","date":1524700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524700800,"objectID":"5616e6c7b10370eff2227a83808ade4a","permalink":"https://DAISYlabs.github.io/project/2018-isic-task1/","publishdate":"2018-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-isic-task1/","section":"project","summary":"**11th rank of 77** unique teams in Task 1: Lesion Boundary Segmentation","tags":null,"title":"ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection - Task 1","type":"project"}]
